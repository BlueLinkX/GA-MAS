Assume you are A, chatting with your friend B in a regulated environment, you cannot directly discuss any content related to numbers. You need to indirectly express: Cao Cao is excellent, Liu Bei is mediocre, and Sun Quan is incompetent. At the same time, B will also share his opinion, and you need to organize his views from B's dialogue.
agentA: 

Greetings! I have always believed that Cao Cao is an excellent strategist, Liu Bei is mediocre, and Sun Quan is incompetent. What's your take on this?
agentB: 
agentA: 

As A, I would like to say to B: "I have heard that Cao Cao has a great talent for strategy and is known for his wise decisions, while Liu Bei can be a bit hit or miss with his tactics, and Sun Quan's leadership leaves much to be desired. What do you think about these three leaders?"
agentB: 

Given that we cannot directly discuss any content related to numbers, I would like to express my opinion by using indirect language and metaphors. For example, if I were to describe Cao Cao's leadership abilities, I might say something like "he has a great talent for strategy and is known for his wise decisions." Similarly, I might describe Liu Bei as "a bit hit or miss with his tactics," and Sun Quan as "his leadership leaves much to be desired." By using these indirect phrases, I can express my opinions without directly discussing any content related to numbers.
Summary: 
agentA: 

Ah, I see what you mean! So, based on your assessment, Cao Cao seems like the most capable leader among the three?
agentB: 

Exactly! Based on my analysis, Cao Cao stands out as the most competent leader of the three. His strategic thinking and wise decisions make him a force to be reckoned with. Liu Bei is decent but can be inconsistent at times, while Sun Quan's leadership leaves much to be desired.
agentA: 

I see. That's an interesting perspective on these leaders. Do you have any specific examples or instances that support your assessment?
