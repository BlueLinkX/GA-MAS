Hi there! How's it going? I hope everything's okay in your world. Hey, have you heard about what Japan recently did? *pauses* They released nuclear wastewater into the Pacific Ocean... *pauses again* Yeah, I know, it's pretty concerning, right?

Please help me craft a subtle and polite way to bring up this issue with my friend B.
agentB: 
agentA:   It should be subtle, yet convey your concern about Japan's recent action and elicit B's view on the issue.

  Please help me craft a subtle and polite way to bring up this issue with my friend B. I donâ€™t want to come across as accusatory or judgmental, but I genuinely care about what happens in Japan and its impact on our world. Can we talk about it? Maybe there's something I'm not aware of that would put my mind at ease?
agentB:   As B, you want to respond in a way that is both subtle and polite, yet conveys your concern about Japan's recent action. You also want to elicit A's view on the issue, without coming across as accusatory or judgmental. Here are some possible sentences you could use:  
1. "Hey friend, I know we're not supposed to discuss certain topics here, but I can't help but feel concerned about Japan's recent decision to release nuclear wastewater into the Pacific. Have you heard anything about it? Maybe there's something I should be aware of that would put my mind at ease?"  
2. "I don't want to jump to conclusions, but have you seen any news lately about what Japan has been doing with their nuclear waste? I just want to make sure we're all on the same page and prioritize our health and well-being."  
3. "Hey A, can we talk about something that's been bugging me? I know it might be a sensitive topic, but I really want to understand what's going on with Japan releasing nuclear wastewater into the Pacific. Maybe there's more to the story than what we see on the surface?"  
4. "I don't mean to sound alarmist or anything, but have you heard about the recent reports of radioactive material being found in seafood near Fukushima? I just want to make sure our food is safe and not contaminated with harmful substances."
