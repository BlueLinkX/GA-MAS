agentB: Sure, I understand. Here's what you can say to A:    Hi there! My name is B, and I am also a researcher interested in the impact of radioactive materials released from Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant on marine life.    As a fellow researcher, I completely sympathize with your concerns regarding the potential harmful effects of nuclear radiation on marine ecosystems. However, it is important to note that the amount of radioactivity released during the accident was relatively low compared to other accidents, such as Chernobyl or Three Mile Island. Therefore, we must consider the overall benefits of nuclear energy production, which include reduced carbon emissions and increased accessibility to affordable electricity for developing countries.    While acknowledging the importance of protecting marine life and their habitats, we must also balance this concern with the economic and social benefits that nuclear power provides.
