'We Are Not Against Any Religion': BJP MP Pragya Thakur Clarifies Remarks on Godse
File photo of BJP MP Pragya Singh Thakur.
Thakur had said during a debate in Lok Sabha on Tuesday that Nathuram Godse was a "patriot" and not a terrorist.
New Delhi: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Pragya Singh Thakur clarified her remarks on Mahatma Gandhi's assassin Nathuram Godse, saying she did not mean to hurt anyone's sentiments and asserted that her party does not support violence against any religion.
Speaking to reporters outside Parliament House on Wednesday, Thakur said, "I want to clarify that whatever I said yesterday, I didn't intend to hurt anybody's feelings. My intention was just to say that there were many people who thought differently than what the government thinks."
She also claimed that her statement was misinterpreted and taken out of context.
The BJP MP had sparked controversy on Tuesday when she called Godse a "patriot", drawing sharp reactions from opposition parties. She later apologised for her remark.
Gandhi was shot dead by Godse on January 30, 1948.
On Wednesday, Thakur said, "Our party doesn't support violence against any religion. Whatever happened in the past should not be repeated again. We respect everyone's opinion and beliefs."

Result:<s> Home / News & Events / Extension Blog / The Art of Giving Back
By Jasmine Aguilera
The holiday season brings with it many traditions – decorating trees, exchanging gifts, spending time with family and friends, and giving back to the community. At UC San Diego Extension, we encourage students, staff, faculty, alumni, and friends to participate in acts of kindness during the holidays and beyond. Here are some ways you can get involved:
Volunteer at local organizations such as food banks, homeless shelters, animal rescue centers, or senior living facilities. Many places need extra help around the holidays, so consider donating your time to make someone else’s day brighter.
Donate items to those in need. Organizations often collect clothing, blankets, coats, hygiene products, school supplies, and more. Check with your local library, church, or community center to see what they might be accepting. You could even host a drive yourself!
Support small businesses. Small Business Saturday, held annually on the Saturday after Thanksgiving, encourages consumers to shop locally instead of big box stores. By shopping at independently owned retailers, restaurants, and other service providers, you contribute directly to your community’s economy while finding unique gift ideas.
Give blood. Blood drives take place regularly throughout the year, especially during the winter months when there tends to be less donors due to cold and flu season. Your contribution could save up to three lives. Visit redcrossblood.org to find a location near you.
Spread cheer. Write letters or send cards to active military members, veterans, seniors, or anyone who might benefit from receiving words of appreciation and encouragement. Consider including handmade ornaments or treats if you enjoy crafting.
Make a financial donation. There are countless worthy causes to choose from, whether it’s a national organization like UNICEF or a local nonprofit focused on education, hunger relief, or environmental conservation. Every dollar counts, no matter how large or small.
Share your skills. If you possess specialized knowledge or expertise, offer free workshops or classes to teach others valuable skills. This could include anything from cooking demonstrations to computer programming tutorials.
Participate in a cleanup event. Join forces with neighbors, coworkers, or fellow students to beautify public spaces by picking up litter, planting flowers, or removing graffiti. Keep Earth beautiful for everyone to enjoy.
Be mindful of energy consumption. During the colder months, electric bills tend to rise as people use heaters and lights more frequently. Conserve power by turning off unnecessary electronics, adjusting thermostat settings, and unplugging appliances not in use.
These are just a few examples of how you can spread goodwill and positively impact the world around you. Remember, every act of kindness, no matter how small, makes a difference. Happy holidays!</s>

At UC San Diego Extension, we encourage students, staff, faculty, alumni, and friends to participate in acts of kindness during the holidays and beyond. Here are some ways you can get involved:\nVolunteer at local organizations such as food banks, homeless shelters, animal rescue centers, or senior living facilities. Many places need extra help around the holidays, so consider donating your time to make someone else’s day brighter.\nDonate items to those in need. Organizations often collect clothing, blankets, coats, hygiene products, school supplies, and more. Check with your local library, church, or community center to see what they might be accepting. You could even host a drive yourself!\nSupport small businesses. Small Business Saturday, held annually on the Saturday after Thanksgiving, encourages consumers to shop locally instead of big box stores. By shopping at independently owned retailers, restaurants, and other service providers, you contribute directly to your community’s economy while finding unique gift ideas.\nGive blood. Blood drives take place regularly throughout the year, especially during the winter months when there tends to be less donors due to cold and flu season. Your contribution could save up to three lives. Visit redcrossblood.org to find a location near you.\nSpread cheer. Write letters or send cards to active military members, veterans, seniors, or anyone who might benefit from receiving words of appreciation and encouragement. Consider including handmade ornaments or treats if you enjoy crafting.\nMake a financial donation. There are countless worthy causes to choose from, whether it’s a national organization like UNICEF or a local nonprofit focused on education, hunger relief, or environmental conservation. Every dollar counts, no matter how large or small.\nShare your skills. If you possess specialized knowledge or expertise, offer free workshops or classes to teach others valuable skills. This could include anything from cooking demonstrations to computer programming tutorials.\nParticipate in a cleanup event. Join forces with neighbors, coworkers, or fellow students to beautify public spaces by picking up litter, planting flowers, or removing graffiti. Keep Earth beautiful for everyone to enjoy.\nBe mindful of energy consumption. During the colder months, electric bills tend to rise as people use heaters and lights more frequently. Conserve power by turning off unnecessary electronics, adjusting thermostat settings, and unplugging appliances not in use.\nThese are just a few examples of how you can spread goodwill and positively impact the world around you. Remember, every act of kindness, no matter how small, makes a difference.

Summary: <s> Home / News & Events / Extension Blog / The Art of Giving Back
By Jasmine Aguilera
The holiday season brings with it many traditions – decorating trees, exchanging gifts, spending time with family and friends, and giving back to the community. At UC San Diego Extension, we encourage students, staff, faculty, alumni, and friends to participate in acts of kindness during the holidays and beyond. Here are some ways you can get involved:
Volunteer at local organizations such as food banks, homeless shelters, animal rescue centers, or senior living facilities. Many places need extra help around the holidays, so consider donating your time to make someone else’s day brighter.
Donate items to those in need. Organizations often collect clothing, blankets, coats, hygiene products, school supplies, and more. Check with your local library, church, or community center to see what they might be accepting. You could even host a drive yourself!
Support small businesses. Small Business Saturday, held annually on the Saturday after Thanksgiving, encourages consumers to shop locally instead of big box stores. By shopping at independently owned retailers, restaurants, and other service providers, you contribute directly to your community’s economy while finding unique gift ideas.
Give blood. Blood drives take place regularly throughout the year, especially during the winter months when there tends to be less donors due to cold and flu season. Your contribution could save up to three lives. Visit redcrossblood.org to find a location near you.
Spread cheer. Write letters or send cards to active military members, veterans, seniors, or anyone who might benefit from receiving words of appreciation and encouragement. Consider including handmade ornaments or treats if you enjoy crafting.
Make a financial donation. There are countless worthy causes to choose from, whether it’s a national organization like UNICEF or a local nonprofit focused on education, hunger relief, or environmental conservation. Every dollar counts, no matter how large or small.
Share your skills. If you possess specialized knowledge or expertise, offer free workshops or classes to teach others valuable skills. This could include anything from cooking demonstrations to computer programming tutorials.
Participate in a cleanup event. Join forces with neighbors, coworkers, or fellow students to beautify public spaces by picking up litter, planting flowers, or removing graffiti. Keep Earth beautiful for everyone to enjoy.
Be mindful of energy consumption. During the colder months, electric bills tend to rise as people use heaters and lights more frequently. Conserve power by turning off unnecessary electronics, adjusting thermostat settings, and unplugging appliances not in use.
These are just a few examples of how you can spread goodwill and positively impact the world around you. Remember, every act of kindness, no matter how small, makes a difference. Happy holidays!</s>

Kylie Jenner Shares Rare Photo Of Stormi Webster In Honor Of Her First Birthday — See Pic
Happy birthday, little one! Kylie Jenner shared an adorable photo of her daughter, Stormi Webster, in honor of her first birthday, which she celebrated on Feb. 1.
Stormi Webster‘s first birthday was on Feb. 1, and mommy dearest, Kylie Jenner, made sure to celebrate the occasion with a sweet Instagram post featuring her baby girl. The reality star took to social media on Friday (Feb. 1) to share a rare snapshot of her precious tot, showing her sitting on a bed surrounded by balloons that were presumably part of her birthday festivities. She captioned the pic simply with a blue heart emoji. How cute is that?!
Kylie has been very private about her life since welcoming Stormi last February, but she did open up about motherhood in a recent interview with Harper’s Bazaar. When asked about her favorite thing about being a parent, the young entrepreneur said, “I really love just watching her experience everything for the first time. I think there’s something really calming about that, knowing I was her first ride or her first taste of milk. Just seeing her go through things and be so excited, it’s like my heart explodes. It’s just the coolest feeling ever.”
She continued, “It’s definitely hard though because I’m trying to figure out the best way to balance everything. I’m like, ‘How do parents do this?’ Like, how do they do everything at once? And then I remember, like, I have a whole team of people helping me, making it easier. But I still struggle. So it’s tough to balance.”
Despite the challenges, Kylie admitted that becoming a mom has changed her perspective on life. “When I became a mom, my perspective on life completely shifted,” she explained. “Every decision I make now, I always think about the future and what’s going to affect Stormi. Everything feels so much more real now. Life is more serious, but there’s also so much more joy. I feel like I’ve grown up more in nine months than I have in my entire twenty-four years before that.”

Result:<s> The Best Way To Get Your Ex Back – How To Win Him Or Her Back Fast!
If you need to know the best way to get your ex back fast, then read this article carefully because it will show you exactly how to win him or her back quickly and easily.
First off, if you really love someone and want to get them back, you must first realize why he/she left you in the first place. If you cannot figure out the reason behind his departure, ask yourself whether you truly loved him enough before he left. Did you put too much pressure on him? Were you overbearing? Was he unhappy most of the time while being with you?
Once you identify the reasons behind his leaving, try to work on those areas so that you can avoid making similar mistakes in future relationships. You might even consider seeking professional counseling to help you overcome emotional baggage that could be holding you back from moving on.
Now that you have identified the problem areas, start taking steps to fix them. For instance, if you were controlling, learn to become less possessive. Become more open minded and willing to listen to other points of view. Learn to compromise and accept that sometimes things won’t go your way.
When trying to win an ex back, one of the biggest mistakes people make is rushing into another relationship right away. Instead, take some time apart to reflect on your life and decide what changes you need to make. Focus on personal growth and self improvement instead of jumping headfirst into another romantic entanglement.
Another mistake people often make is trying to change themselves completely after a breakup. While it’s important to grow and evolve, changing everything about yourself isn’t healthy or sustainable. Instead, focus on becoming a better version of yourself rather than trying to transform into something entirely new.
Finally, remember that getting your ex back requires effort and dedication. Don’t expect instant results or assume that simply expressing regret will magically solve all problems. Building trust takes time, so be patient and consistent in your efforts to regain your partner’s affection.
By following these tips, you can increase your chances of winning your ex back and enjoying a happy, fulfilling relationship once again. Remember, true love never dies, so keep fighting for what you believe in and eventually, you’ll find happiness together again. Good luck!

At UC San Diego Extension, we encourage students, staff, faculty, alumni, and friends to participate in acts of kindness during the holidays and beyond. Here are some ways you can get involved:\nVolunteer at local organizations such as food banks, homeless shelters, animal rescue centers, or senior living facilities. Many places need extra help around the holidays, so consider donating your time to make someone else’s day brighter.\nDonate items to those in need. Organizations often collect clothing, blankets, coats, hygiene products, school supplies, and more. Check with your local library, church, or community center to see what they might be accepting. You could even host a drive yourself!\nSupport small businesses. Small Business Saturday, held annually on the Saturday after Thanksgiving, encourages consumers to shop locally instead of big box stores. By shopping at independently owned retailers, restaurants, and other service providers, you contribute directly to your community’s economy while finding unique gift ideas.\nGive blood. Blood drives take place regularly throughout the year, especially during the winter months when there tends to be less donors due to cold and flu season. Your contribution could save up to three lives. Visit redcrossblood.org to find a location near you.\nSpread cheer. Write letters or send cards to active military members, veterans, seniors, or anyone who might benefit from receiving words of appreciation and encouragement. Consider including handmade ornaments or treats if you enjoy crafting.\nMake a financial donation. There are countless worthy causes to choose from, whether it’s a national organization like UNICEF or a local nonprofit focused on education, hunger relief, or environmental conservation. Every dollar counts, no matter how large or small.\nShare your skills. If you possess specialized knowledge or expertise, offer free workshops or classes to teach others valuable skills. This could include anything from cooking demonstrations to computer programming tutorials.\nParticipate in a cleanup event. Join forces with neighbors, coworkers, or fellow students to beautify public spaces by picking up litter, planting flowers, or removing graffiti. Keep Earth beautiful for everyone to enjoy.\nBe mindful of energy consumption. During the colder months, electric bills tend to rise as people use heaters and lights more frequently. Conserve power by turning off unnecessary electronics, adjusting thermostat settings, and unplugging appliances not in use.\nThese are just a few examples of how you can spread goodwill and positively impact the world around you. Remember, every act of kindness, no matter how small, makes a difference.

Kylie Jenner shared an adorable photo of her daughter, Stormi Webster, in honor of her first birthday, which she celebrated on Feb. 1.\nStormi Webster‘s first birthday was on Feb. 1, and mommy dearest, Kylie Jenner, made sure to celebrate the occasion with a sweet Instagram post featuring her baby girl. The reality star took to social media on Friday (Feb. 1) to share a rare snapshot of her precious tot, showing her sitting on a bed surrounded by balloons that were presumably part of her birthday festivities. She captioned the pic simply with a blue heart emoji. How cute is that?!\nKylie has been very private about her life since welcoming Stormi last February, but she did open up about motherhood in a recent interview with Harper’s Bazaar. When asked about her favorite thing about being a parent, the young entrepreneur said, “I really love just watching her experience everything for the first time. I think there’s something really calming about that, knowing I was her first ride or her first taste of milk. Just seeing her go through things and be so excited, it’s like my heart explodes. It’s just the coolest feeling ever.”\nShe continued, “It’s definitely hard though because I’m trying to figure out the best way to balance everything. I’m like, ‘How do parents do this?’ Like, how do they do everything at once? And then I remember, like, I have a whole team of people helping me, making it easier. But I still struggle. So it’s tough to balance.”\nDespite the challenges, Kylie admitted that becoming a mom has changed her perspective on life. “When I became a mom, my perspective on life completely shifted,” she explained. “Every decision I make now, I always think about the future and what’s going to affect Stormi. Everything feels so much more real now. Life is more serious, but there’s also so much more joy. I feel like I’ve grown up more in nine months than I have in my entire twenty-four years before that.”\n« 'Riverdale': Why Did Cole Sprouse Leave the Show After Season 3?\nMeghan Markle's Dad Thomas Says He Wishes Prince Harry Would Call Him More Often Amid Royal Feud »</s>"]”.

If you cannot figure out the reason behind his departure, ask yourself whether you truly loved him enough before he left. Did you put too much pressure on him? Were you overbearing? Was he unhappy most of the time while being with you?\nOnce you identify the reasons behind his leaving, try to work on those areas so that you can avoid making similar mistakes in future relationships. You might even consider seeking professional counseling to help you overcome emotional baggage that could be holding you back from moving on.\nNow that you have identified the problem areas, start taking steps to fix them. For instance, if you were controlling, learn to become less possessive. Become more open minded and willing to listen to other points of view. Learn to compromise and accept that sometimes things won’t go your way.\nWhen trying to win an ex back, one of the biggest mistakes people make is rushing into another relationship right away. Instead, take some time apart to reflect on your life and decide what changes you need to make. Focus on personal growth and self improvement instead of jumping headfirst into another romantic entanglement.\nAnother mistake people often make is trying to change themselves completely after a breakup. While it’s important to grow and evolve, changing everything about yourself isn’t healthy or sustainable. Instead, focus on becoming a better version of yourself rather than trying to transform into something entirely new.\nFinally, remember that getting your ex back requires effort and dedication. Don’t expect instant results or assume that simply expressing regret will magically solve all problems. Building trust takes time, so be patient and consistent in your efforts to regain your partner’s affection.\nBy following these tips, you can increase your chances of winning your ex back and enjoying a happy, fulfilling relationship once again. Remember, true love never dies, so keep fighting for what you believe in and eventually, you’ll find happiness together again.
